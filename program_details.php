          <p class="card-text1">As the death toll from Monday’s deadly earthquake in Turkey and Syria passes 20,000 people, charities across the US are fundraising to support earthquake victims in both countries.

            Rescue workers search for survivors among the rubble of a destroyed building in the Rihawi area in Latakia province, northwestern Syria, on 8 February 2023.

            Read more
            The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is collecting funds for its disaster response emergency fund, which supports “immediate cash assistance” in affected areas, reported the New York Times.
            
            The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, a nonprofit that has provided healthcare services within Syria and to Syrian refugees in Turkey since 2012, is seeking donations to fund medical support in north-west Syria, particularly given the great need in the area.
            
            Organizations like the Syrian American Medical Society are collecting funds to support medical efforts in the area, with at least seven of its hospitals and medical facilities damaged due to the earthquake.
              
            In New York, groups like the Long Island’s Turkish Cultural Center is collecting money for those impacted by the earthquake, reported NBC New York.
            
            New York City officials have also published a portal to connect those interested in donating to charities helping on the ground, including the International Red Cross, Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders.
         
            Never provide personal details, bank account information, or other information without verifying the organization or individual collecting donations.Turkey’s death toll has climbed above 41,000, the country’s disaster authority has said. This number is expected to rise further, given that more than 345,000 apartments were destroyed and many people are still unaccounted for. In Syria, already devastated by years of war, authorities have said more than 5,800 people died.

            Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s Europe director, said relief workers were facing “the worst natural disaster in the region for a century”, adding that 26 million people need assistance across both countries. The WHO launched the largest rescue operation of its kind in the organisation’s 75-year history.

          <p class="card-text">Under the Caritas India programme SUPOSHAN, a rally on the Right to Food was organized across 10 villages, with a high concentration of Mahadalit communities, from 20-24 August 2019, in Munger district of Bihar. The rally was kicked off from the Mahadalit hamlets passing through Village Presidents’ residences various Fair Price Shops under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).

            The rally covered Musahar hamlets, namely Biranchi Tola, Masudan tola, Dariyapur, Chandwali Asthan, Shyampur, Galimpur, Raghunathpur, Manghgaye, Dariyapur, and Gobbadda.Members of the mothers’ collectives and community development collectives co-designed the rally to make it effective and meet the objective of creating awareness among the people and the duty bearers on high malnutrition among Mahadalit communities. Slogans were raised by members of adolescent collectives and handbills were distributed.

            The immediate result of the people marching on foot was that the president of village Gobadda, in Haveli Kharagpur block, assured the people of surveying the villages to assess the households lacking the TPDS registration, and ensure their coverage under the scheme by the end of the year; have a PDS shop in their hamlets, with regular and timely delivery of the ration. While giving out the assurance, he recognized the leadership of the women in this rally. A contingent of adolescent girls from Roshni Ki Toli shared about the dissatisfactory status of mid-day-meal in their schools and asked for improvement and compliance to the food menu. 
            
            “Roshni Pariyojna ke madhyam se gaon me kiye ja rahe pahal se ek din in Musharo ke jeevan badal jayega aur ye bhi samaj ke mukhya dhara se jud jayenge” (With the efforts being made under Roshni programme, the Musahar community will also get mainstreamed in the society one day, surely), said the village president.

          <p class="card-text">he various initiatives of Kerala in the area of lifestyle diseases were hailed as the best in the country and worthy of emulation by other States at the national conference of Chief Secretaries from all over the country, a statement issued by the Office of the Health Minister here said on Monday.


            The initiatives of Kerala – non-communicable diseases detection campaign, SWAAS programme for the systematic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other serious respiratory illnesses, the programme for screening and detection of retinopathy, palliative care programme, comprehensive newborn screening for birth defects and hub-and-spoke model lab diagnosis system – were hailed as some of the best practices in health sector in the country, the statement said.
            
            The conference of Chief Secretaries was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
			The Centre has taken note of at least four states ruled by Opposition parties that were found to not comply at all with the Centre-mandated façade design of Ayushman Bharat health and wellness centres, with the Punjab government going a step ahead by branding such centres as Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinic. Although deviations such as the buildings coloured white or blue instead of the suggested yellow, and bearing boards stating primary health centre or sub-centre was found in the other three states of Kerala, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu, the name change in Punjab prompted the Centre to assume that the state had stopped implementing the health and wellness centre scheme.

A letter from mission Director Roli Singh earlier this month said that since the state had “stopped” implementing the programme under National Health Mission “therefore releases to the state under NHM do not appear to be feasible”. According to Health ministry officials, letters of compliance to such design needs were sent to all other states.

The state has been funded for upgrade and running of 379 primary health and wellness centres, 2,488 sub-centres, and 162 urban PHC-health and wellness centres.
            
            Kerala’s attempts to prevent and manage lifestyle diseases and the State government’s new policy initiatives to tackle malnutrition, cancer care strategy, antimicrobial resistance surveillance programme, tuberculosis (TB) detection and outbreak response system also found mention at the conference, the statement said..

          <h5 class="card-title">Overcoming A Tragedy: We Can Help Those Affected By The Odisha Train Accident</h5>
          <p class="card-text4">June 3, 2023 will forever be etched in the memories of the people of Odisha and the country, as the state witnessed one of the deadliest train accidents in recent Indian history. The collision involving three trains has left 288 people dead and over 1,000 injured, many of whom are fighting for their lives.

            The accident took place around 06:55 PM near the Bahanaga Bazar station, located approximately 270 kilometers (170 miles) south of Kolkata. The trains involved in the collision were the Coromandel Express, which had commenced its journey from Shalimar railway station in West Bengal and was en route to Chennai, and the Howrah Superfast Express, which had originated from Yesvantpur station in Bengaluru and was destined for Howrah. Additionally, a stationery goods train was present at the Bahanaga Bazar station.
            
            Eyewitnesses and railway officials have revealed that the Coromandel Express that had left Balasore for Bhadrakh was derailed off the main line and and collided with the stationary goods train at the Bahanga station in the up loop line after a sudden change in the electronic interlocking forces. The impact of the collision caused the derailed carriages of the Coromandel Express to strike the rear two carriages of the Howrah Superfast Express that was travelling on the down line in the opposite direction, resulting in further derailment. The series of events unfolded rapidly, leaving a trail of destruction.
            
            Both passenger trains had approached the station under a green signal, indicating that it was safe to proceed, and were traveling at the usual speed of under 130 kilometers per hour (81 miles per hour). The severity of the accident caused 17 coaches from the two passenger trains to derail and sustain severe damage, exacerbating the already catastrophic situation.

          <p class="card-text">The International Day of Charity was established with the objective of sensitizing and mobilizing people, NGOs, and stakeholders all around the world to to help others through volunteer and philanthropic activities.

            Mother Teresa of CalcuttaThe date of 5 September was chosen in order to commemorate the anniversary of the passing away of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 "for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitute a threat to peace."
            
            Mother Teresa, the renowned nun and missionary, was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in 1910. In 1928 she went to India, where she devoted herself to helping the destitute. In 1948 she became an Indian citizen and founded the order of Missionaries of Charity in Kolkota (Calcutta) in 1950, which became noted for its work among the poor and the dying in that city.
            
            For over 45 years she ministered to the poor, sick, orphaned and dying, while guiding the Missionaries of Charity’s expansion, first in India and then in other countries, including hospices and homes for the poorest and homeless. Mother Teresa’s work has been recognized and acclaimed throughout the world and she has received a number of awards and distinctions, including the Nobel Peace Prize. Mother Teresa died on September 5th 1997, at 87 years of age.
            
            In recognition of the role of charity in alleviating humanitarian crises and human suffering within and among nations, as well as of the efforts of charitable organizations and individuals, including the work of Mother Teresa, the General Assembly of the United Nations in its resolution A/RES/67/105 designated the 5th of September, the anniversary of the death of Mother Teresa, as the International Day of Charity.

          <h5 class="card-title">Help Children in India</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Home to some of the most ancient surviving civilizations, today’s India is the world’s largest democracy and a rising economic powerhouse. But it is tackling major social, economic and environmental issues, including a huge gap between the wealthy and those living in poverty.

            While there is more wealth in India than ever before, and significant progress has been made, it hasn’t fully translated into health care and nutrition, education or better protection for all, especially India’s most marginalized and deprived children.
            
            Challenges for Children in India
            While India surges ahead as a driving force in the world economy, tens of millions of children are being left behind. Children from the most vulnerable communities, including those from the lowest castes and tribes, from religious minority groups and girls, don’t have an equal chance to succeed. Too many children are stunted due to severe malnutrition. Child marriage, child labor and poverty are persistent challenges.
            
            1 child in 27 dies before their 5th birthday, 5 times the U.S. rate
            35% of children suffer from stunting due to malnutrition
            20% of children are out of school, with 28% engaged in child labor
            16% of girls (ages 15-19) are married, and 34% of girls (ages 15+) struggle to read and write
            22% of people live in poverty.We’re in the most disadvantaged communities, educating adults about children’s rights so they understand that children are meant to be at school and not work
Through children’s groups, we’re helping girls and boys work on solutions to help themselves and each other and ensure their rights are respected
We’re identifying out-of-school children, street children and those who are involved in child labor and facilitate their movement into schools through enrollment drives
We continue to reach marginalized youth through New Horizons, a skills training program that builds economically viable skills among adolescents vulnerable to or engaged in exploitative work
